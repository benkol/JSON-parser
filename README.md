# JSON-parser
Tectonic's home exercise

A home exercise I recieved from Tectonic. The task's description was:

Your task is to develop a reusable UI component that retrieves JSON data from a given URL and shows it in a tree view where nodes can be expanded and collapsed.
The page that contains the component must be able to control the URL from which the data is obtained. The URL is assumed to be available publicly without authentication. Changing the URL should make the component refetch the data.
The choice of visual style is up to you.
